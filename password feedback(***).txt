You can enable the password feedback feature in /etc/sudoers file, 
but first create a backup of the file, 
then open it for editing using the visudo command.

  $ sudo cp /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.bak
  $ sudo visudo 

Search for the following line:

  Defaults env_reset
  
And append pwfeedback to it, so that it looks like this.

  Defaults env_reset,pwfeedback
  
Save the file by hitting "Ctrl+o" and then "Ctrl+x" to close it.
Or if using vi press "Esc" key and type ":wq" to save and close the file.

Then run the command below to reset your terminal for the above changes to start working.

  $ reset
